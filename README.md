# Why Content Styles?

This effort is based on the following tenet:

> "There will always be scenarios where users will need to write markup,
> for poetry or prose (as opposed to for structuring and presentation), 
> either directly or through some degree of indirection,
> and there should be a mechanism for making that markup look pretty good
> in some existing system."
